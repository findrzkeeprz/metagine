Stuff to do:
-----------------

* Object factory class implementation.
* Re-seperate game logic into external module.
* Sound/music playback support.
* Developer console that interfaces with engine components (Mostly done).
* Dynamic approximation for rotational sprites, currently inefficient.
* Tile engine that integrates with sprite and renderer classes.
* Loading of assets from XML files (via TinyXml) - sprites done.
* Game state management (menus, pause screen etc).
* Need ability to set sprite colour key from XML file.
* Cache set amount of previous text renders.
* Make variable manager responsible for deleting registered variables.
* Update sprite + XML handling to support different anim sequences.

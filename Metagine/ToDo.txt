Stuff to do:
-----------------

* Object factory class implementation.
* Re-seperate game logic into external module.
* Sound/music playback support.
* Developer console that interfaces with engine components (Mostly done).
* Dynamic approximation for rotational sprites, currently inefficient.
* Renderer needs to maintain multiple drawable lists for z-depth sorting.

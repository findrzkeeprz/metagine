 ABOUT
 
 Metagine is a 2D game engine written in C++ using SDL
 and other supporting libraries. I'm developing the
 engine primarily as a learning curve and so that I
 have a framework with which I can develop 2D games 
 for competitions such as Ludum Dare.

 COMPILING
 
 Originally written for the Linux platform, I since
 ported the code to support Windows only for various
 reasons.
 
 I have only tested compilation with Microsoft Visual
 Studio 2008 Professional. All external libraries are
 included in source distribution with the exception
 of Boost.
 
 TICKETS/CONTRIBUTE
 
 I am accepting fixes and contributions to the project.
 Issues can be found at the GitHub repository page.
